Building a HTML/CSS landing page with Brad Traversy

Brad Traversy and Traversy Media is a great resource for learning. To keep myself out of tutorial hell, I'm learning a bit, and then applying that knowledge in build along projects of different sorts. This is to expand my knowledge of design principles and to see what I've learned in action. 

Big takeaways from this project: ID and class names are important, and it's okay to name most HTML elements. I found that this showed a great deal of control over the structure of the page. 

My biggest challenge: we build the entire structure first, and I missed a closing </div>. This was only visible to me when styling in CSS and rules weren't applied. Going through the HTML to find the missing tag is finding a needle in a div-stack. Build the HTML carefully and make sure the opening and closing tags are matched before you start.
